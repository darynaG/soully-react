From missed chances to a life-long passion, this book is romantic on so many levels, but never once cheesy."

Clare is in love with Henry, a man with time placement disorder who she meets when she is just 6 years old. Every time he comes into her life he is a different age and thinks their relationship is at a stage. This is the book to read if you need reminding that love can overcome all odds."

    "description":"Satirical novel published in 1759 that is the best-known work by Voltaire. It is a savage denunciation of metaphysical optimism--as espoused by the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz--that reveals a world of horrors and folly. In this philosophical fantasy, naive Candide sees and suffers such misfortune that he ultimately rejects the philosophy of his tutor Doctor Pangloss, who claims that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. Candide and his companions--Pangloss, his beloved Cunegonde, and his servant Cacambo--display an instinct for survival that provides them hope in an otherwise somber setting. When they all retire together to a simple life on a small farm, they discover that the secret of happiness is to cultivate one's garden a practical philosophy that excludes excessive idealism and nebulous metaphysics."

Quick refresher: It was about a college-age girl who sleeps with an older man because she feels like she “owes” it to him, not quite because she wants to. In her debut collection, Roupenian continues to explore the inner workings of sex, trauma, kinks, and manipulation."

But before she can make it big, she finds herself at the center of a community controversy, while her mom is struggling to make ends meet at home. Equal parts heartbreaking and full of hope, On the Come Up proves Thomas has many more stories to tell."
